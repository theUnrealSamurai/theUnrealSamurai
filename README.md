# Heyooo! ðŸ‘‹  
Bringing ideas to life since 2015

Iâ€™m Roshan Saravanan â€“ A linux nerd, problem solver, and Tech. uhhh... Tech. I mean everything.  When Iâ€™m not building models to automate everything under the sun, youâ€™ll find me speed-typing, cycling to mordor and back, or geeking out over new ways to make machines smarter.

Currently AI Engineer at Mamiya IT Solutions in Tokyo â€“ working on everything from defect detection systems to chatbots, and everything in between. 

## What I Do
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Turning data into insights (and sometimes chaos, but mostly insights).
- **Web & App Development**: Built apps, tools, and some cool stuff on the web.
- **ML Ops**: From Docker containers to FastAPI â€“ keeping things smooth, scalable, and snappy.

## Skills  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Flask, Docker, Flutter, and other stuff give me documentation and I can work with anything

## Fun Stuff
- **Languages**: Fluent in English, Tamil, Kannada and Japanese â€“ can ask for directions in Hindi (Beginner, They forced me to learn this).
- **Hobbies**: Typing faster than you, cycling like a maniac, and finding new ways to make AI do my bidding.  
- **Achievements**: Bronze medal in Kaggle's COVID-19 detection challenge, some cool object detection models, and too many random projects to list.
