# Hey there! I'm RoshanðŸ‘‹  

I've been writing codes since 2016, started as an hobby trying top install a mod in a video game, It looked cooler when I did it, I liked and I'm still writing codes today. 

I specialize at Machine learning. Mostly Natural language and computer vision. 

Techstack: Python, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, CrewAI, OpenAISDK, faiss, Pinecone, Flask, FastAPI and whatever that has documentation and a need for me.
