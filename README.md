# Hey there! I'm RoshanðŸ‘‹  

I've been writing codes since 2016, started as an hobby, now do I do it for a living. And I sometimes contribute to OSS if it's something I use on a regular basis. Again mostly just fixing the bugs that annoy me or adding features I want. 

I specialize at Machine learning. Mostly Natural language and computer vision. 

Techstack: Python, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, CrewAI, OpenAISDK, faiss, Pinecone, Flask, FastAPI and basically anything. If it has documentation, Great! If it doesn't have documentation, Just give me some time.

Got something? contact me here roshan.saravanan001@gmail.com
