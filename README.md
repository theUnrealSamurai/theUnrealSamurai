# Heyooo! ðŸ‘‹  
Bringing ideas to life since 2015

Iâ€™m Roshan Saravanan â€“ AI enthusiast, problem solver, and lover of all things tech. When Iâ€™m not building models to automate everything under the sun, youâ€™ll find me speed-typing, biking, or geeking out over new ways to make machines smarter.

Currently AI Engineer at Mamiya IT Solutions in Tokyo â€“ working on everything from defect detection systems to chatbots, and everything in between. ðŸš€

## What I Do
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Turning data into insights (and sometimes chaos, but mostly insights).
- **Web & App Development**: Built apps, tools, and some cool stuff on the web.
- **ML Ops**: From Docker containers to FastAPI â€“ keeping things smooth, scalable, and snappy.

## Skills  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Flask, Docker, Flutter  
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, Colab, Kaggle  
- **Languages**: Fluent in English, Tamil, Kannada â€“ can ask for directions in Japanese (N4 level).

## Fun Stuff
- **Hobbies**: Typing faster than you, biking like a maniac, and finding new ways to make AI do my bidding.  
- **Achievements**: Bronze medal in Kaggle's COVID-19 detection challenge, some cool object detection models, and too many random projects to list. ðŸ˜Ž
